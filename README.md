# LSEMS AMU Paperwork Generator

This is a paperwork generator for a GTA 5 RP server for use of the Los Santos Emergency Medical Services Department. The means of this is to output BBCode for posting to the website that this is used on. The project is setup to use TypeScript, but isn't using it at this time.
